# FreeCAD Scripted Objects Modern API

## Audience

This is for developers of FreeCAD extensions commonly known
as Feature Python Objects or more generally Scripted Objects.

This is a python API, it is expected that the readers are python developers with
a little more than basic python coding skills. The API does not use any obscure 
language feature but it uses classes, functions, decorators, type hints, etc...

It is also expected that the readers are FreeCAD users, and have a good understanding
of the basic usage of it.

## Deliverables

* `fpo.py `
  This is the API implementation
* `examples/`
  contains basic usage examples of the api
* `docs/`
  contains source and generated documentation

## Documentation
